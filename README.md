Hi, my name is Pratik Senapati, and I'm new to Web Development.
This is my first project following The Odin Project.
It's about building a website using HTML about Recipes, and I've added my very own 
special recipe.
I learnt how to successfully make my own website using HTMl using images, ordered and unordered lists, and pushing my first project to a repository on Github using Ubuntu on a VM on my PC.
